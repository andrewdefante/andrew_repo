    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most sports these days, the top levels of motorsport are very data rich and data driven. Formula 1 in particular champions many groundbreaking developments in data science, such as the ability to stream large amounts of data quickly to the pit wall and back to the team's home factories for further analysis during on-track sessions (practice, qualifying, and the race itself). In the role of a race strategy engineer, it is imperative to develop an effective data driven approach to plan out a race weekend and strategy, while also being able to translate observed on-track activity, factor in changing track and weather conditions, and understand the impact each driver and car has on the data collected. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are no shortage of applications, packages, and algorithms to feed data into and return a value or set of values. While the power of these methods should not be understated, I believe that teams are on a level playing field in this regard. However, I would argue that differences can be made by having appropriate domain knowledge along with effective communication and understanding amongst the different stakeholders of the team to develop powerful features to feed into whatever models are chosen. Being able to translate what happens on track into features that can be incorporated into a predictive model is what gives strength and confidence for the computer predicted value returned. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, a machine learning algorithm can take a driver's previous ten laps as feature inputs to return a projected lap time for the eleventh lap. Every team has access to the lap times, and would be able to run the same model. However, this approach fails to take into account the many other confounding variables that can influence a lap time. Perhaps the driver was stuck in traffic behind other cars, or they pushed too hard in the early laps and degraded their tyres too much. \n",
    "\n",
    "This report outlines my approach and thought process behind developing feature inputs based on existing data, and buliding two predictive models for the example above. Then the effectiveness of these features and models will be evaluated against observed data from an actual race (2021 Azerbaijan Grand Prix). "

    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the feature development and predictive modeling workflow, the fastf1 api package was utilized to query lap time data from the 2021 Azerbaijan Grand Prix. During this race, the Aston Martin of Sebastian Vettel was able to secure a P2 result after the team. This result was laregly in part to the strategy deployed by the team, especially early in the race when the first round of pit stops took place. Vettel was able to extend his first stint much longer than his opponent Yuki Tsunoda ahead of him, and was able to conserve his tyres and find pace when needed allowing him to jump positions after all the cars pitted. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the models developed and deployed by the teams have much more data at their disposal to incorporate, the same approach can be taken to make use of existing data elements and interpolate them in different ways to try and improve projection confidence. Additionally, teams can use data from practice and sessions as inputs for their models. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection\n",
    "The fastf1 api package provides the abiltity to query race lap time data from a database. The documentation can be found here().\n",
    "\n",
    "The data output from the query includes many variables, but this analysis will make use of the timing data in particular (lap times for each lap per driver). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Transformation and Feature Development\n",
    "\n",
    "After querying the raw data, the output was exported and loaded into a SQLite database for transformation. While the same transformations can be made with pandas, numpy and other python packages, SQLite/DBBrowser allows for efficient database development and intuitive joining and transformation workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the raw data, a series of feature inputs for the predictive models were developed. This was done with the overarching principle of calculating deltas and aggregating sums per driver. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generating features that are appropriately weighted allows for the projection to be unique to what each driver and car are capable of. Grouping the data by driver to calculate the values for the variables above allows for the predictions to reflect the characteristics of the driver themselves. Because the driver is ultimately the one piloting the car, their own characteristics and skillset is reflected in the data fed into the model via the relative time delta calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predictive Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the features were developed, the data was fed into two different regression algorithms. \n",
    "   - Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "   - XGBoost Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the target variable to be predicted is continuous (lap time in seconds), regression is the appropriate approach to take. \n",
    "\n",
    "With how data rich the sport is, I think the difference can be made in how the data avaliable is interpreted. While the discussion about what model to fit or algorithm to use is certainly important, I believe that developing features by interpolating existing data is key to bridging the gap between a computer generated prediction and what is observed on track.

    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "The tyre compound each driver was on will be used as feature inputs for the model, as they have a direct impact on performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three tyre compounds a team can choose to fit on their car during a race:\n",
    "   - Soft (Red) - allows for faster laps/more grip but high rate of degradation and sooner drop off in performance\n",
    "   - Hard (White) - slower laps/less grip, but lower rate of degradation and allows for driver to stay on track longer before coming into the pits to change out for a new fresh set\n",
    "   - Medium (Yellow) - balanced tyre out of the three, in the middle in regard to grip level/rate of degradation\n",
    "\n",
    "One other element to consider is that during a race, a team must use at least two different tyre compounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is crucial to determine the best tyre compound to fit and when in order to maximize the race result."

These values could also be determined from the practice sessions. A target average lap and target fastest lap on each tyre compound could be taken from observations during practice."

    "Comparing the magnitude of the feature scores is relative to the data. Each feature score can be interpreted as the effect of adding a value of magnitude 1 to each feature. As an example, Feature 4 pertains to TyreLife. According to the model fit, an increase in TyreLife by 1 results in change of -1.8 seconds to the output value. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the convention is that an increase in TyreLife results in slower pace, could be due to the smaller sample size of data used to train the model. Additionally, while a three second decrease in lap time might be unrealistic in magnitude, it still shows that the trend is pointing towards faster lap times as the laps go on. This supports what was observed in the race, as Aston Martin elected to extend Vettel's first stint and keep him out on older tyres. Vettel's observed lap time was 107.065, consistent with the projection that Vettel could pick up the pace. He eventually jumped Tsunoda and pitted on Lap 18. "

    "## Limitations and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated earlier, there are a number of limitations regarding the predictions made with both models and their real time application. Since both models theoretically would take live data fed from timing software trackside, the strength of the predictions would be dependent on the data avaliable at the time. For instance, if no teams were running the Hard compound early in the race, the strength of the prediction for lap times on the Hards would be impacted. It cannot be re-iterated enough that the strength of the model is dependent on the feature inputs. While data can certainly be imported from practice sessions, the trade off between real-time track conditions and representive data is something to consider. Conditions on track can evolve drastically, especially during the race (not including the impact of weather, wind, etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I argue that it is crucial for a team to approach model development with a priority in feature development and integration. Before bringing data into a model, how can a team take the existing data and transform/interpret it in a way that is useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, both model's feature importance plots show that the generated variable of rolling lap time average carries the strongest weight. While the tyre compound fitted is undoubtedly important, those feature inputs carried less weight. Looking at a race weekend comprehensively, practice sessions could be used to collect data to calculate a reasonable rolling lap time average and fastest lap. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am aware that there are many advanced utilities to simulate lap times such as RACE software, Canopy solutions, etc. However, these utilities still require feature inputs, and thinking creatively about how to interpolate raw data into useful inputs is where teams can generate gaps from others. \n",
    "\n",
    "A possible area of further exploration would be to generate a prediction of when a car will come into the pits, based on the same feature inputs. \n"
